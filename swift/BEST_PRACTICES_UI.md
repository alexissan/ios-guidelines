## Auto Layout

### Tools

Use only system's built-in autolayout tools. Using any third party tool (like SDCAutoLayout, SnapKit, ...) is discarded at the moment.

> SDCAutoLayout is included in some of our projects at the moment. It's usage should be considered deprecated. Consider removing existing usages proactively when modifying related code.
